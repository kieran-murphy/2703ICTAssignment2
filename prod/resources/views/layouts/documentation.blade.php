    <h2>What I was able to complete</h2>
    I was able to complete 90% of the features outlined in the task sheet, including login, registering, <br> CRUD on products and reviews, following, likes and a unique recommendation feature. <br>
    The unfollow feature, and a proper implementation of likes and roles were unable to be completed within the given timeframe.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    The process used for the assignment was simply hard work and effective time management. Following <br> each week's content that added Laravel features helped as the combination of all those features led<br>
    to the final product in this assignment. Testing for this assignment was frequent and as new features <br> were added Laravel's seeder feature made testing easier by being able to create large amounts of <br>
    data quickly and easily. If there was a third assignment I would complete it differently by asking the <br> teacher for more help more often in class instead of spending hours stuck on one problem at a time.

    <h2>Recommendation Feature</h2>
    The recommendation feature implemented in this assignment is a quite unique and interesting way of <br> helping users find the product they are interested in finding. It is a search field that takes in a word <br>
    or phrase that will be searched for in the database to find the product with the most reviews related to <br> that keyword. If no results are found then the user will be prompted to make another search. Some <br>
    example keywords are provided for the user.
